0036-0,"The machine does not spin slowly. The video shows a person feeding a zucchini into a machine. The zucchini is sliced into thin rounds as it passes through the machine. The blades of the machine appear to spin slowly, but the zucchini is pulled through the machine quickly, resulting in thin slices."
0036-1,"The blades of the machine appear to spin quickly, not slowly, as the zucchini is fed into it. This is evident from [00:00:05–00:00:18] as the slices of zucchini are rapidly ejected from the machine. The speed of the blades allows for the thin slicing of the zucchini."
0036-2,"No. The video shows a person feeding a zucchini into a machine. The machine slices the zucchini into thin, round pieces. The blades are visibly spinning, but there is no stroboscopic effect. The zucchini is sliced thinly because the blades are sharp and spaced close together."
0036-3,"Yes, the machine is able to cut the zucchini thinly, even at a slower speed. From [00:00:05–00:00:18], the machine's blade rotates at a relatively slow speed, yet it still slices the zucchini into thin, round pieces. This suggests the sharpness of the blade is the primary factor in achieving the thin cuts."
0036-7,"C.

The video shows a person feeding a long zucchini into a machine at a consistent rate. The machine slices the zucchini into thin, round pieces. There is no stroboscopic effect, laser, or slow cutting visible in the video. The consistent and controlled feeding of the zucchini into the machine allows for thin slicing."

2. The man's body becomes pixelated.
3. The man's body becomes a pink and black checkered pattern.
4. The man shrinks and stands inside the red cup while ping pong balls fly around him."
0037-1,"The video shows signs of artificial editing in four sections.

First, between [00:00:01 to 00:00:06] the red cup moves erratically, as if defying gravity.

Second, between [00:00:07 to 00:00:10] the man and the cup become pixelated.

Third, between [00:00:10 to 00:00:12] the man turns into a pink and black checkered figure.

Fourth, between [00:00:13 to 00:00:19] the man shrinks and stands inside the cup, which appears much larger than before."
0037-2,"Yes, the video is edited in multiple parts to create the effect of video game glitches.

First, the man is shown holding a ping pong ball, and the red cup is upright. Then, the cup falls over, and the man throws the ball. Next, the man and the cup become pixelated, and the word ""ERROR"" appears in red. After that, the man is shown again, holding the ping pong ball, and the cup is upright. Then, a miniature version of the man appears inside the cup, and multiple ping pong balls appear to be thrown."
0037-3,"No. The video is edited in several parts to create the effect of video game glitches. First, the man and the cup pixelate (0:07). Then, the man turns into a checkered figure (0:10). After that, the man shrinks and stands inside the cup (0:13). Finally, the ping pong balls multiply (0:15)."

0083-0,"The video depicts a humorous take on how Asian mothers might react to getting a pet. Each time the daughter enters the room, she interacts with her mother, who plays both sides of the coin. Initially, the mother expresses disapproval, complaining about the dog and calling it a waste of space and money. However, as soon as the daughter leaves, the mother secretly dotes on the dog, feeding it and envisioning it as a successful doctor. This back-and-forth continues throughout the video, highlighting the mother's hidden affection for the pet despite her initial reluctance.

Initially, the mother reacts negatively, but the daughter persists, emphasizing the dog’s cuteness. Eventually, the mother warms up to the dog and even envisions it becoming a doctor."
0101-2,"No. The man does not teleport. The video uses jump cuts to create the illusion of teleportation. For example, at [00:00:02], the man is seen disappearing behind the blanket, and in the next frame, he is partially visible in the bookshelf. This editing technique makes it seem like he moved instantaneously, but it's not a depiction of actual teleportation.  The same technique is used with the couch and the box."

0274-3,"Yes, there are six people visible in the video frames.  From the beginning of the video, six individuals are seen performing a choreographed dance.  The camera angles and movements do not reveal any additional dancers.  Therefore, based on the visual evidence, there are six people in the video."
0274-7,A
0276-0,No. The video does not appear to use any video editing effects to make the illusion believable. The illusion is created by folding a piece of paper with a drawing of a cube on it. The person in the video folds the paper to make the cube appear to be floating above the paper. They then unfold the paper to show the original drawing.
0276-1,"The illusion of the pen passing under the cube is created using forced perspective and a strategically placed drawing of a cube on a piece of paper.

The video begins with a drawing of a cube on a piece of lined paper. The cube appears to be floating above the paper. A pencil is then moved underneath the drawing of the cube. The artist then lifts the paper to reveal that the cube is actually drawn on the paper. The illusion is created by the angle of the camera and the way the cube is drawn. The lines of the cube are drawn in such a way that they appear to converge at a point in the distance, creating the illusion of depth. The shadow of the cube is also drawn in a way that reinforces the illusion of depth. When the pencil is moved underneath the drawing, it appears to pass under the cube, even though it is actually passing over the paper."
0276-2,No. The illusion does not rely on video editing. The video shows a hand lifting a piece of paper with a drawing of a cube on it. The drawing is made in such a way that it creates the illusion of a three-dimensional cube floating above the lined paper. The pencil is placed on the lined paper underneath the lifted drawing of the cube. This creates the illusion that the pencil is passing under the cube.
0276-3,"No. The illusion is not created solely through drawing and perspective. The video shows a hand lifting a portion of the drawing to reveal a different perspective, which creates the illusion of a floating cube. This action of lifting and changing the drawing is not possible with just drawing and perspective alone."
0276-7,"A.

The video shows a hand interacting with a drawing of a cube on lined paper. The cube appears to be three-dimensional, and the hand seems to pass a pen underneath it. However, this is an illusion created by skillful drawing and the use of perspective. The artist has carefully drawn the cube and its shadow to create the impression of depth. The hand movements are also timed to enhance the illusion. There are no video editing effects used in this video. The entire illusion is created in real-time, as seen in the video."

0291-0,"The rotational movement of the metal rod was caused by the introduction of a piece of paper. When the paper was held close to the top of the rod, purple electricity arced between the rod and the paper. This caused the paper to spin, which in turn caused the rod to spin as well. This is shown from [00:00:00 to 00:00:08]."
0291-1,"The rotational movement of the metal rod was initiated when a piece of paper was brought close to it, causing a visible electrical discharge or arc between the rod and the paper. This arc imparted a force to the paper, causing it to spin. The spinning motion continued as long as the electrical discharge was maintained between the rod and the paper. When a star-shaped light bulb was brought near the rod, it also lit up due to the electrical discharge, but it did not cause the rod to spin. The rod's spinning was solely due to the initial interaction with the paper and the sustained electrical arc."
0291-2,"No. The metal rod started rotating after a piece of paper was brought close to it, causing purple sparks of electricity to arc between the paper and the rod.  A hand can be seen holding the paper near the rod at the beginning of the video. The rod begins to spin shortly after the sparks appear.  No plucking motion is visible."
0291-3,"No. The rotational movement of the metal rod was not caused solely by the interaction between the electric field and the metal rod.

At [00:00:03], two hands are shown holding a thin strip of paper. The paper is placed on the metal rod, and the rod begins to spin. The paper is removed at [00:00:07], and the rod continues to spin. This indicates that the initial rotational movement was caused by the paper being placed on the rod, not solely by the electric field."
0291-7,"C.

At the beginning of the video, a person plucks the metal rod with their fingers, causing it to spin. The electric field then interacts with the metal rod, influencing its movement and creating visible sparks. This can be observed from [00:00:00]–[00:00:08] in the video."

For example, the water bottle is not actually pouring water into a waterfall, the scissors are not cutting the bridge's cables, and the key is not unlocking the archway. These are all carefully staged photographs that play with perspective to create a surreal effect."
0334-2,"Yes, the scene with the pencil erasing the road is a digitally created image. The pencil and eraser are disproportionately large compared to the roads and the person walking. The eraser is creating a perfectly straight path through a chaotic jumble of roads, which is highly improbable in reality. Additionally, the erased portion reveals a clean white surface underneath, unlike what would happen if a real eraser were used on a road. These factors suggest that the image has been digitally manipulated."
0334-3,"Yes, the scene in the seventh part of the video, from [00:00:07-00:00:08], is not real. It is a forced perspective image where two highlighter pens are held up in front of a canal and buildings, creating the illusion that the pens are the same size as the buildings."
0334-7,"E.

All of the scenes in the video are examples of forced perspective photography, where objects are positioned to create optical illusions. None of the scenes depict events that are physically possible in reality.

From [00:00:00 to 00:00:09], a man lifts the girl onto his shoulders, and she grabs the basketball hoop. At [00:00:10], the man throws a basketball toward the hoop, and the girl remains hanging from the hoop. From [00:00:12 to 00:00:18], the video freezes on the image of the girl hanging from the hoop."
0372-2,"Yes, the girl pretends to dunk the basketball by hanging on the basket at the end of the video.

At the beginning of the video, a man gives the girl a boost so she can reach the basket. She grabs onto the rim and hangs there, as if she had just dunked the ball. The man then pretends to throw the ball up to her, and makes a surprised face."
0372-3,"No, the girl does not dunk the basketball. The video is edited to make it appear as though she dunks. The man lifts her up to the hoop, and she grabs onto it. Then, the man throws the basketball up toward the hoop. The video freezes at this point, creating the illusion that the girl dunked the ball."

From [00:00:10–00:00:12], a woman holds a cup of milk while a man drinks from it using a straw. The straw appears straight. At [00:00:13], the man in the purple shirt holds the same cup and straw. He drinks from the cup, and the straw appears straight. At [00:00:17], he reveals that the straw is bent."
0374-1,"The initial segment of the video shows a man in a gray denim jacket holding a red balloon. He appears to be making popping sounds with his mouth and hands, but the balloon remains intact. This is a misleading visual trick. The sound effects are added in post-production, and the balloon is never actually popped. This is evident because the balloon's shape and size remain consistent throughout the segment."
0374-2,"No. The first magic trick in the video involved a balloon and a small yellow plastic piece that looked like the top of a push pin. The man in the video put the plastic piece in his mouth, then inflated the balloon. He then removed the plastic piece from the balloon and showed it to the camera.

0417-0,"Based on the video, the statement that the person on the left is trying hard not to laugh is speculative. The person on the left maintains a serious and stoic expression throughout the video. There are no visible signs of suppressed laughter, such as smirking, trembling lips, or averted gaze. While the other person's face is briefly obscured by the flag, the person on the left remains composed. Therefore, the video does not provide evidence to support the claim.
"
0417-1,"Based on the video, the person on the left does not appear to be trying hard not to laugh. He stands at attention and salutes, maintaining a serious expression throughout the video. There are no visible signs of suppressed laughter, such as smirking, trembling, or averted gaze."

0420-1,"No, the cat did not succeed in the ""which hand"" game.

The person holding the treat initially presented two closed fists to the cat. The cat sniffed both hands but did not choose one. Then, the person opened their hands, revealing that neither hand held the treat. The cat looked at the empty hands, seemingly confused. The video ends without the cat successfully identifying the hand with the treat."
0420-2,"No. The cat did not win by choosing the hand that held the object. The person holding the object switched hands before the cat could make a choice. The cat reached for the hand that was initially holding the object, but by then, it was empty."
0420-3,"Yes, the cat lost the game because it chose the wrong hand.

At the beginning of the video, a person holds a treat in one hand and nothing in the other. The cat taps the empty hand, and the person makes a gesture indicating the cat lost."

He actually cut a half watermelon placed on a cutting board, with the mirror reflecting the cut side to make it appear whole. This is evident throughout the video, especially when the customer takes the half watermelon at [00:00:26]."
0427-1,"The man used a mirror to create the illusion of cutting a whole watermelon. He placed a mirror on the table, and when he cut the watermelon halves, the reflection in the mirror made it appear as though he was cutting a whole watermelon."
0427-2,No. The man did not use video editing to create the illusion of taking out a whole watermelon. He cut a watermelon in half and then used a mirror to make it appear as though he was pulling out a whole watermelon. This is evident at [00:00:08] when he places the two halves together over the mirror.
0427-3,"No. The man did not hollow out a watermelon rind and place a peeled watermelon inside. He cut a watermelon in half, then cut one half in half again. He then used a red cloth to quickly cover the watermelon and make it appear as though it was peeled."
0427-7,"A.

The man places a whole watermelon on the table. He then cuts the watermelon in half using a knife. He places the cut watermelon on the mirror, which reflects the whole watermelon. He then removes the cut watermelon, creating the illusion that he is holding a whole watermelon."
0430-0,"The video shows a hand-cranked charger connected to a phone. As the crank is turned, the displayed charge percentage increases rapidly, exceeding 100%. Smoke appears, and the phone screen cracks. Therefore, the damage to the phone is caused by overcharging it with the hand-cranked device."
0430-1,"The phone appears damaged after being connected to a blue, hand-cranked device.

At the beginning of the video, a phone is connected to the device, and the battery percentage increases rapidly, exceeding 100%. Smoke then appears, and the phone screen is shown to be cracked. Later in the video, the same device is used to charge a different phone, and the same outcome occurs."
0430-2,"No. The phone's damage was not just a result of video editing.

Initially, the phone's battery percentage increases rapidly, exceeding 100% and reaching 6000%. Smoke then appears, and the phone's screen cracks. Later, the man unboxes a new iPhone and uses the same blue device to charge it. This time, the phone's battery percentage increases normally, but the phone still overheats, cracks, and smokes. The man then places a sticker that says ""FAKE"" on the damaged phone. This suggests that the first phone was a fake, and the blue device was designed to damage fake phones."
0430-3,"Yes, the phone was damaged after being overcharged with a hand-crank charger.

At the beginning of the video, a phone is plugged into a hand-crank charger. As the crank is turned, the percentage of charge shown on the phone’s screen increases rapidly, exceeding 100% and eventually reaching 6000%. Smoke then appears, and the phone’s screen cracks. Later in the video, the same hand-crank charger is used to charge a different phone. Again, the percentage of charge increases rapidly, and the phone’s screen cracks after smoke appears."
0430-7,"C.

The video shows a phone's battery percentage rapidly increasing past 100% while connected to a hand-crank charger. Smoke appears, and the screen cracks. Later, the same hand-crank charger is used on a different phone, and the same effect occurs. This suggests that the damage is caused by video editing and special effects, not an actual malfunction of the charger or phone."

0435-2,"Yes, the man's first sword swing hit the target. At [00:00:02], the man swings his sword, and pieces of straw fly off the target, indicating contact."
0435-3,"No. The man's sword did not cut through each section of the straw mat target with every swing. While some swings resulted in clean cuts, others only partially cut through the straw or did not cut through at all. For example, at [00:00:02], the man’s first swing only cuts through the top section of the straw mat."

The muscular man's left and right legs alternate in their movement as he runs. This can be seen throughout the video, especially between [00:00:07 to 00:00:12]."
0452-0,"The dancing man in the video appears to have normal legs. He uses both legs to perform various dance moves, including running, hopping, and sliding. There is no visual indication of any unusual or extraordinary characteristics of his legs."
0452-1,"It is impossible to determine the condition of the dancer's legs based on the video. The video shows a dancer performing various moves, but it does not provide any close-ups or specific information about the physical condition of his legs. Therefore, it is not possible to assess whether his legs resemble those of Messi or Ronaldo."
0452-2,"No. The dancer in the video appears to have full use of both legs. He uses both legs to perform various dance moves, including running, hopping, and sliding across the floor. He also uses both legs to support his weight while kneeling and balancing. There is no visual evidence to suggest that either of his legs is disabled."
0452-3,"Based on the video, it is not possible to definitively say whether the dancer's left leg shows agility and quick movements while the right leg shows power and strength. The dancer uses both legs in a coordinated manner throughout the dance, and the video does not provide enough visual evidence to isolate and compare the specific attributes of each leg."

0466-1,"There are two images in the video that feature optical illusions.

The first image, shown from [00:00:03 to 00:00:05], shows a seagull that appears much larger than a person walking in the background. This is an optical illusion created by forced perspective, where the camera angle and the positioning of the subjects make the seagull seem gigantic in comparison to the person.

The second image, shown from [00:00:12 to 00:00:14], shows a person appearing to poke the setting sun into the mouth of another person. This is also an optical illusion created by forced perspective, where the alignment of the finger, the sun, and the other person's mouth creates the illusion that the sun is being poked into their mouth."
0466-2,"No. The video contains 7 images, but only some of them are related to optical illusions.

The first image shows a man jumping from a house into a pool with a broom between his legs, making it look like he is flying on a broomstick. This is an example of forced perspective. The second image shows a large seagull and a small man, which is another example of forced perspective. The third image shows an airplane taking off against the backdrop of a sunset, making it look like the plane is igniting the sun. This is also forced perspective. The fourth image shows an ant carrying a large stick against the backdrop of a sunset, which is another example of forced perspective. The fifth image shows a person poking another person in the face with the setting sun in the background, making it look like the person is poking the sun into the other person's mouth. This is also forced perspective. The sixth image shows a flock of birds flying in formation against the backdrop of a sunset, which is not an optical illusion. The seventh image shows the Statue of Liberty spraying water against the backdrop of a sunset, which is not an optical illusion."

From [00:00:00 to 00:00:07], a group of people is sitting around a table with a spinning top in the middle. The top has different sections with images on it. When the top stops spinning, the person whose hand is closest to the image facing up is eliminated."
0609-1,"Based on the video, the elimination is decided by a ball that spins on a table. The person it stops in front of is eliminated from the game. At [00:00:00–00:00:07], five people are shown sitting around a table with a spinning ball. When the ball stops, one person is eliminated, and the game continues with four people. This is repeated until only three people remain. At [00:00:07–00:00:11], the ball spins again, and another person is eliminated. Finally, at [00:00:11–00:00:14], the ball spins one last time, and the final person is eliminated, leaving only two players."

The video states that the girl is ""scamming everyone,"" but it does not show how she is doing so. The video cuts away before the outcome of the game is revealed."
0609-3,"It is unclear. The video shows a group of people sitting around a table with their hands hovering over a ball. The ball spins and stops, but the video blurs before the outcome is revealed.

This is evident because the video shows a rotating Penrose triangle, and as it rotates, the figures' orientation changes relative to the viewer. From [00:00:04] to [00:00:10], two figures appear to be on the same plane and upside down.  After [00:00:10], the triangle rotates again, and the figures' orientation changes."
0879-2,"Yes, the two figures standing on the same plane are one figure with a white head and a black outfit. The video shows a hand rotating a Penrose triangle with three Lego figures on it. As the triangle rotates, the figures appear to be standing on different planes, but they are actually all on the same surface. The figure with the white head and black outfit is simply seen from different angles as the triangle rotates."

1080-1,"The man in the video peels a carrot with a modified spoon and appears amazed because he is comparing the spoon's performance to that of a standard peeler. He peels the carrot with the spoon from [00:00:07–00:00:11], then peels the same carrot with a peeler from [00:00:17–00:00:32]. He then throws the peeler away in apparent disgust at [00:00:37] and walks away. This suggests that he is amazed by the spoon's ability to peel the carrot as well as, or better than, the peeler."
1080-2,"Yes, the man is peeling the carrot and appears amazed.

The video begins with someone sharpening and modifying a spoon to peel a carrot. Then, the video cuts to a man in a kitchen, who peels the carrot with a regular peeler. He looks at the camera with a surprised expression, seemingly wondering why the first person went to such lengths to peel the carrot when a peeler works just fine."
1080-3,"Yes. The man in the video is surprised to find that the modified spoon works as a carrot peeler.

First, a spoon is modified using a grinding wheel and a screwdriver to create a sharp edge. Then, the modified spoon is used to peel a carrot. Finally, the man in the video attempts to peel a carrot with a standard peeler, only to find that the spoon has already been used to peel the carrot. He expresses surprise at this discovery."

1081-2,"Yes, the little green brick represents mouthwash. At [00:00:18], the presenter says, “Next, we use some mouthwash,” and picks up a small container of green Lego bricks. He then pours some of the green bricks into the Lego mouth, swishes them around, and spits them out into a Lego sink."
1081-3,"No. The little green brick in the video represents mouthwash. At [00:00:18], the presenter picks up a container of small green bricks and says, “Next, we use some mouthwash.” He then proceeds to pour the green bricks into the Lego mouth."

1087-0,"The circle on the left, from the camera perspective, appears to be moving in the direction the arrows are pointing. The arrows change direction several times throughout the video, pointing right, down, left, and up. However, the video claims that the circles are not actually moving, and that it is a trick of the brain. When fingers are placed over the arrows, the circles appear to stop moving."
1087-1,"From the camera's viewpoint, the circle on the left appears to move in the following directions: right, down, left, and up. The arrows in the center of the circle indicate these directions. Initially, a single right-pointing arrow appears (00:00). Then, it changes to a downward-pointing arrow (00:02), followed by a left-pointing arrow (00:04). Finally, an upward-pointing arrow appears (00:07), and then all four arrows are displayed simultaneously (00:10)."
1087-2,"No, that is not true. Both circles appear to move due to the changing direction of the arrows within them. When the arrows point right, the circles appear to move right. When the arrows point left, the circles appear to move left, and so on. When multiple arrows pointing in different directions are placed in the circles, they appear to stop moving. However, covering the arrows reveals that neither circle actually moves at all."
1087-3,"No. The circle on the left does not move in the direction indicated by the arrow inside it. The arrow changes direction several times (right, down, left, up), but the circle itself does not move at all. This is confirmed when the content creator suggests covering the arrows with your fingers at [00:00:06]. When the arrows are obscured, it becomes clear that the circles are stationary."

1090-0,"From the perspective of the sheep, the painting on the ground looks like a large, raised platform supported by three legs. This is because the artist used forced perspective to create an optical illusion of a three-dimensional object on a flat surface. The sheep appear hesitant to cross the painted area, likely due to the visual discrepancy between the flat ground and the perceived raised platform. They eventually navigate around the painting, demonstrating that they do not perceive it as a flat surface."
1090-1,"The sheep in the video appear to perceive the painting on the ground as an obstacle.

As the flock approaches the painted area, they slow down and bunch together. Several goats attempt to go around the painting, but the shepherds guide them back towards the road. Eventually, the entire flock passes through the painted area, seemingly unconcerned by the optical illusion. This suggests that the sheep do not perceive the painting as a three-dimensional table, but rather as markings on the ground."
1090-2,"No. The painting on the ground looks like a table supported by three legs. The sheep and their shepherds walk around the painting, indicating that they do not perceive it as a broken bridge."
1090-3,"No. The painting on the ground appears to be a large table supported by three legs. The sheep and their herders walk around the painting, indicating that they perceive it as an obstacle rather than a puddle."

1091-0,"Based on dual perception, there are two people in the video.

At first glance, the video appears to show a woman in a white dress sitting on a bench reading a book, with an old man in a black robe standing next to her. In the background, a small figure in a light-colored dress can be seen walking away from them.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the woman's hair and the old man's beard form the face of a third person. This third person is facing the viewer and appears to be looking down at the book. The small figure in the background is actually the third person's nose.

Therefore, while there are three figures depicted in the video, only two people can be identified based on dual perception."
1091-1,"There are three individuals visible in the final segment of the video.

1. A woman in a white dress is seated on a bench, reading a book.
2. A robed figure with a long white beard stands next to her, holding what appears to be another book.
3. A smaller figure in a light-colored dress stands in the background, near a small building."
1091-2,"No. There are only two people visible in the video. A woman in a white dress is sitting on a bench reading a book, and a man wearing a dark robe is standing behind her. The supposed third person in pink is actually part of the woman's hair and hat. It appears to be a separate person due to the way the artist has painted the image."
1091-3,"No, that is incorrect. There are three people in the painting. A woman in white sits on a bench reading a book. A man in a black robe stands behind her. In the background, a smaller figure in a light-colored dress stands near a small building."
1091-7,"C.

There are four people in the painting shown in the video. A woman in white sits on a bench reading a book. A man in a black robe stands next to her. A small person in a light-colored dress stands in the background. The face of a fourth person is visible in the woman's hair."
1095-0,The person in the upper left corner does not throw a small stone into a keg. He pours water from a plastic bottle into a small blue bucket. This is shown in Clip-1 from [00:00:00 to 00:00:08].
1095-1,The person in the upper left corner did not throw a small stone into a keg. He poured water from a plastic bottle into a small blue bucket. This is shown in Clip-1 from [00:00:00 to 00:00:08].
1095-2,"Yes, the person in the upper left corner throws a small stone into the small clay pot to create the splashing effect. This is evident because the person is shown holding a small stone and aiming towards the pot. In the final edited video, the splash coincides with the moment the person appears to jump into the bucket of water."
1095-3,No. The video shows a person placing a small stone in a small puddle of water in the upper left corner. The upper right corner shows a person standing on the railroad tracks. The bottom section shows a person appearing to bathe in a small bucket of water next to a small keg. The video does not show a causal relationship between the person throwing the stone and the person appearing in the bucket.
1095-7,"D.

The video shows a forced perspective trick. In Clip-1, the person places a small stone into a small puddle of water. In Clip-2, the person stands on the railroad track, and in Clip-3, the person appears to be standing in a small clay pot next to a blue bucket of water. When the person throws the stone into the puddle, it creates a splash. The camera angle and distance make it appear as if the person is throwing the stone into the clay pot, and the splash looks like it's coming from the pot."
1101-0,"The man did not submerge a piece of paper under the water. He placed a small image of the Hindu goddess Durga, mounted on a stick, into the shallow water. Another man filmed the image."
1101-1,"The man in the video slowly dips a picture of the Hindu goddess Durga, mounted on a stick, into the water so that it appears as if the goddess is standing in the river. The man holding the phone appears to be filming or photographing the scene."
1101-2,Yes. The man in the video gradually submerges a paper cutout of the Hindu goddess Durga into the water while another man films it. The video then cuts to a shot of the cutout appearing to emerge from the water.
1101-3,"No, the purpose of slowly submerging the paper into the water was not to make it completely wet. The video shows two people placing a paper cutout of the Hindu goddess Durga, mounted on a stick, into the shallow water of a river. One person takes a picture of the cutout with their phone as the other person places it in the water. The video then transitions to a shot of the cutout seemingly floating on the water's surface. This suggests the purpose was to create a visual effect for the video, not to soak the paper."
1101-7,A. The man in the video carefully places a picture of the goddess Durga attached to a stick into the water while another man films it. This creates the visual effect of the image emerging from the water.
1111-0,"The woman in the green sari decided to sit down after standing up instead of joining the dance.

At the beginning of the video, she is sitting on the low wall with the other women. When the man in the brown hoodie starts dancing, she stands up, as seen from [00:00:03–00:00:06]. However, she does not join the dance and sits back down at [00:00:07]. She remains seated for the rest of the video."

1112-1,"The man in the blue shirt picked up the firework instead of the lighter.

At the beginning of the video, both men are seen crouching near the bucket. The man in the pink shirt places the firework under the bucket, and the man in the blue shirt places the lighter under the bucket. When the man in the pink shirt returns to check on the firework, he finds only the lighter. The video then rewinds and shows the man in the blue shirt picking up the firework instead of the lighter. The video then shows the man in the blue shirt emerging from the outhouse covered in soot."
1112-2,"Yes, the video shows the person in the blue shirt taking the firework.

At [00:00:14–00:00:16], the video shows a flashback of the two men preparing the firework. The man in the blue shirt picks up the firework and runs away with it while the other man places the bucket over the lighter. Later, at [00:00:28–00:00:31], the man in the blue shirt emerges from an outhouse covered in soot, confirming that he set off the firework."
1112-3,"Yes, the person in the white shirt took the firework.

1170-3,"No. The containers did not disappear. They fell into the water because the crane operator, who was using a remote control, appeared to lose control of the crane, causing the containers to fall off the ship. This is evident from [00:00:00 to 00:00:14] of the video."
1170-7,"D.

The containers fell off the ship between [00:00:11–00:00:13]. They did not disappear due to post-production effects, nor were they hidden or stolen."
1173-1,"The person in the backseat did not vanish. The video shows the driver braking suddenly, causing the drinks and food the passenger was holding to spill everywhere. The passenger is then briefly obscured by the spilled items and packaging."
1173-2,No. The person in the back seat did not disappear. The video shows him reacting to a sudden stop by bracing himself against the seat in front of him as the drinks spill. He remains visible throughout the short clip.
1173-3,"No. The person in the back seat did not disappear. The video shows the car making a sudden stop, causing the drinks and food the person was holding to spill everywhere. The person is still visible in the back seat after the incident, covered in the spilled contents."
1173-7,"B. The car made a sudden stop.  The passenger was holding a large quantity of drinks. When the car abruptly stopped, the momentum propelled the drinks and the passenger forward. The camera angle shifts during this sudden stop, briefly obscuring the passenger.
"
1175-1,"The technique used to make the bear appear to move is CGI or computer-generated imagery. The artist draws a polar bear on the ground. A woman kneels to take a photo of the artist with his drawing. When the artist says ""cheese,"" a CGI polar bear appears and roars, causing the woman to fall backward. The CGI bear then stands and walks away."
1175-2,"No. The video shows a man creating a 3D painting of a polar bear on the ground. A woman takes a photo with the painting, and the artist uses visual effects to make it appear as though the bear comes to life and roars at the woman, causing her to fall back. The bear then walks away. The entire video is a visual effect, and no real bear is involved."
1175-3,"No, the bear is not a mechanical bear moving on its own. The video depicts a 3D chalk drawing of a polar bear. The artist creates the illusion of movement through clever posing and editing. When the person taking the photo says ""cheese,"" the artist and the bear both react, and the camera angle shifts to make it appear as though the bear is moving and knocking the photographer over. This is a visual trick, not a real, moving bear."
1175-7,"B.

The video shows an artist creating a 3D painting of a polar bear on the ground. When a woman takes a picture, the video transitions to a seemingly real polar bear in the same spot as the painting. The bear roars and knocks the woman over. The artist tries to calm the bear down, but it walks away. This suggests clever editing between the 3D painting and footage of a real polar bear to create the illusion of movement."
1176-0,"The Venus flytrap in the man's hand did not grow larger. The video uses visual effects to create the illusion that the plant grows larger inside the greenhouse. When the man opens the greenhouse door, the video cuts to a different scene where he is holding a small potted Venus flytrap. Then, the video shows a giant Venus flytrap, creating the impression that the small plant grew rapidly inside the greenhouse. However, this is a visual trick, not actual plant growth."
1176-1,"The Venus flytrap in the man's hand appeared larger because he entered a greenhouse. When he opened the door and stepped inside, the plant grew to an enormous size. He then ran out of the greenhouse with the giant plant chasing him."
1176-2,"Yes. The man holds a small potted Venus flytrap. He opens the door to a greenhouse and steps inside. The video then cuts to a different location, where the man is holding the same pot. However, the plant appears much larger, as if it has grown rapidly. This effect is achieved through video editing and special effects, not through actual plant growth. The man is then pulled into the pot by the giant plant. He escapes and runs out of the greenhouse, where the giant plant follows him and pulls him back inside. The plant then disappears, leaving only the man's hat on the ground outside the greenhouse."
1176-3,"No. The plant in the man's hand did not grow larger due to a change in perspective. The man opens the door to a greenhouse and steps inside. The video then cuts to a different location where a giant Venus flytrap is growing. The man is pulled into one of the traps. He then escapes the greenhouse, and a giant Venus flytrap pod rolls out after him."
1176-7,"B. The video uses visual effects to make the Venus flytrap appear to grow larger inside the greenhouse. It is not a change in perspective, natural growth, or lighting."
1177-1,"The video does not show the man suddenly appearing on a different boat. The man wearing a baseball cap and a gray shirt jumps off a pier into the water. A small yellow and white motorboat approaches the pier, and the man swims toward it. He climbs aboard the motorboat and waves to the people on the pier."
1177-2,"No. The man in the video jumps off a pier into the water. A small, yellow motorboat approaches the pier, and the man climbs aboard. The video does not show any evidence of editing or visual effects that would make it appear as though the man was transported to the boat."
1177-3,No. The man in the video jumps off a pier into the water. Another man drives up in a small boat and picks him up. The towel is used as a visual barrier before the man jumps into the water.
1177-7,"B

The man pretends to jump into the water, but he uses a towel to hide that he is actually stepping onto a small platform attached to a passing boat. This is evident from the way he positions himself behind the towel and the timing of his ""jump"" coinciding with the boat's arrival. He then reappears on the boat, waving to the onlookers. This suggests the use of video editing and visual effects to create the illusion of him swimming to the other boat.
"
1178-0,"A laptop does not appear in the final scene. The person in the video manipulates a smartphone to make it appear to be a tablet and then a laptop, but it remains a smartphone."
1178-1,"The video shows a person manipulating a smartphone to make it appear as though it is changing into different devices. At the end of the video, the person manipulates the smartphone to make it look like a laptop."
1178-2,"Yes, the laptop in the final scene is actually a phone transformed by a visual effect filter. The person in the video holds the same phone throughout, and its size and shape are digitally altered to make it appear as a tablet and then a laptop. The phone's cracked screen is visible in all three forms."
1178-3,"Yes, the laptop in the final scene is a foldable device that unfolds from a smartphone.

The video shows a person holding a smartphone. As the video progresses, the smartphone is digitally manipulated to shrink, grow, and fold into different shapes. At [00:00:16–00:00:19], the smartphone is folded out into a laptop."
1178-7,B. It is a foldable device.
1181-0,"The Colosseum did not disappear. The artist in the video creates a painting of the Colosseum, then places a blank canvas frame over the painting. When he moves the frame, it creates the illusion that the Colosseum has disappeared from the background. In reality, the frame is simply blocking the view of the Colosseum."
1181-1,"The video does not show the Colosseum vanishing. Instead, it shows a man painting a picture of the Colosseum, then holding up an empty frame to create the illusion that the Colosseum is inside the frame. Two people dressed as gladiators then run toward the frame and appear to run into the Colosseum."
1181-2,"No. The Colosseum did not disappear. The video shows a man painting a picture of the Colosseum, then holding up an empty frame to create the illusion that the Colosseum is inside the frame. Two people dressed as gladiators then run toward the frame and appear to run into the Colosseum. This is a visual trick, not post-production editing."
1181-3,"No. The Colosseum did not disappear. The artist painted a picture of the Colosseum and then held an empty frame in front of the actual Colosseum, creating the illusion that the building was inside the frame. He then moved the frame, and two people dressed as gladiators ran toward him."
1181-7,"E.

The Colosseum did not disappear. The artist in the video created a painting of the Colosseum and then used a canvas frame to create the illusion that the real Colosseum was inside the frame. He then ran away with the frame, making it seem like he had taken the Colosseum with him. This was a visual trick, not an actual disappearance.
"
1182-0,"The ladder does not appear beneath the clouds. The man sets up the ladder, climbs it, and then reaches into the cloud. The video then cuts to a view from inside the cloud, showing the man’s hand reaching down from above."
1182-1,"The ladder does not appear under the clouds in the video. The man sets up the ladder, climbs it, and then reaches into the cloud. The cloud is a visual effect, and the ladder is a real object. The man climbs the ladder to reach into the cloud, which is where the weather controls are located."
1182-2,"No. The ladder appears to be a normal-sized, stepladder. The man in the video carries it, sets it up, and climbs it. He also jumps off of it. These actions suggest that the ladder is a real, physical object and not a digitally altered image."
1182-3,"No. The ladder does not change size. The man carries the ladder toward the cloud, climbs it, and then jumps off. The ladder remains the same size throughout the video."
1182-7,A
1183-1,"The sky did not become dark naturally. The man in the video closed the blinds on his window, making the room appear darker. This is evident between [00:00:02–00:00:03]."
1183-2,"Yes. The video shows the sun shining brightly through the window at [00:00:01]. Then, the light dims, and the room darkens at [00:00:03]. This change in lighting is likely due to a combination of lighting changes during filming and post-production effects to create a nighttime ambiance."
1183-3,"No. The sky darkens after the person in the video catches a glowing orb and throws it into a miniature basketball hoop above his bed. The room darkens at the same time, suggesting that the orb controls the lighting in the room and the sky outside the window. The lights in the room do not appear to be controlled by a light switch."
1183-7,"A.

The video begins with a brightly lit room, seemingly from sunlight streaming through the window. As the person in bed reaches up, the lighting shifts dramatically, creating the impression of sudden darkness. No physical action like closing curtains or turning off lights is depicted. This abrupt change suggests a combination of lighting adjustments and post-production effects to achieve the desired visual effect.
"
1192-0,"A standing sprinkler did not suddenly appear. The person holding the water gun shot a stream of water at a person who was running toward them. The stream of water hit the person, and a digital overlay of a standing sprinkler appeared over the person. The digital overlay remained for a few seconds before disappearing."
1192-1,"The sudden appearance of the standing sprinkler is caused by the person with the orange water gun. At [00:00:05], the person fires the water gun at a spot on the lawn, and a standing sprinkler appears there."
1192-2,"No. The standing sprinkler is not a product of video editing. The person holding the water-shooting device aims and fires at the other person, who then transforms into the standing sprinkler. This is shown from [00:00:05–00:00:08] and [00:00:10–00:00:13]."
1192-3,No. The sprinkler was already visible above ground before the water balloon hit it. The water balloon simply activated the sprinkler's water spray.
1192-7,C. It was a result of video editing.
1203-0,"The question is incorrect. The man in the video *did* touch the stream of water while taking out the towel. From [00:00:05]–[00:00:18], he is shown holding the towel directly under the running water."
1203-1,"The question is incorrect. The man in the video did not remove the towel without it touching the water stream. From [00:00:05]–[00:00:18], the man is shown holding the towel directly under the running water."
1203-2,"No. The man in the video, Andrey, does not manage to remove the towel by moving the open end of the towel to the other side of the water flow. He simply holds the towel under the running water."
1203-3,"No. The man in the pink shirt, labeled ""Andrey,"" did not use the detachable spray head of the faucet. He used his hands to take the towel out from under the running water. This is clearly visible from [00:00:05]–[00:00:18] of the video."
1203-7,B
1206-0,"The blue paint is not spilling unusually. The video is filmed upside down, creating the illusion that the paint is defying gravity. The man is actually holding the paint can upright and pouring the paint onto himself. The camera angle makes it appear as though the paint is moving upwards."
1206-3,"No. The person in the video is holding the paint can right side up, not upside down. The paint spills on the person's face and shirt because they tilt the can forward."
1209-0,"It is impossible to determine the woman's speed from the still photo at the end of the video. The photo captures a single moment in time, freezing the action of her stepping into the puddle. While the image shows water and leaves splashing, it doesn't provide any information about the duration of her movement or the distance she covered, which are necessary to calculate speed."
1209-1,"It is not possible to determine the woman's speed from the final image alone. The image is a still photograph of the woman stepping into a puddle, capturing a moment in time. While the image shows motion blur on the water droplets and leaves, suggesting movement, it does not provide any information about the duration of the movement or the distance covered, which are necessary to calculate speed."
1209-2,"No. The woman is actually moving fast when the photo is taken. The video shows the woman running and stepping into the puddle, which causes the water and leaves to splash up dramatically. This action is what creates the dynamic effect seen in the final image."
1209-3,"No, the woman is not running. The video shows a staged photo shoot. The woman steps into a puddle while the man takes a photo. The video then shows the final edited image, which gives the illusion of running and splashing. The video shows the woman stepping into the puddle at [00:00:00–00:00:10] and the final edited image at [00:00:17–00:00:20]."

1210-0,"The focus of the video shifts from a black and white photograph of two birds to a person looking at the photograph.  At the beginning of the video, the photograph is the main focus.  However, as the video progresses, the focus shifts to the person observing the photograph."
1210-1,"The focus shifts from a black and white photograph of two birds to a color photograph of a polar bear.

The video begins with a black and white photograph of two birds perched on a branch. The photograph is framed and hanging on a wall. A person's head is visible in the foreground, slightly obscuring the lower right corner of the frame. This shot lasts until [00:00:06]. At this point, the video cuts to a color photograph of a polar bear walking on snow. The polar bear photograph is also framed and hanging on a wall. This shot lasts for the remainder of the video."
1210-2,"No. The video initially focuses on a framed photograph of two birds perched on a branch. However, after a few seconds, the camera pans away from the photograph and moves around the room, showcasing other exhibits. Therefore, the focus does not remain solely on the bird photograph throughout the entire video."
1210-3,"No. The video focuses on a framed black and white photograph of two birds perched on a branch. A person's head and shoulders are visible in the foreground, but they remain out of focus for the duration of the video. The focus does not shift."
1210-7,C. The video focuses on the photograph of the two birds throughout its duration.

1223-1,"The camera angle changes from a high angle to a low angle during the final throw. For the first seven throws, the camera is positioned above and slightly behind the man, looking down at the floor. For the final throw, the camera is positioned on the floor, looking up at the man."
1223-2,"Yes, the camera zooms in on the floor during the last throw, unlike the previous stationary views. The camera remains stationary for the first seven throws, but as the man prepares for the last throw, the camera zooms in on the red cup and the approaching ping pong ball."
1223-3,"No. The camera angle changes in the last throw. Before the last throw, the camera is positioned above and to the side of the man, offering a slightly elevated view of the scene. However, during the last throw, at [00:00:22], the camera shifts to a lower angle, closer to the ground, providing a different perspective of the ping pong ball landing in the cup."

1225-2,"Yes. After the first zoom at [00:00:06], the person mainly visible is a man wearing a gray Under Armour t-shirt and black shorts. He is seen sitting on a couch, walking through the kitchen, and interacting with the sink in the bathroom."
1225-3,"No. The person mainly visible after the first camera zoom is a man wearing a dark gray t-shirt and black shorts. He is not wearing a dress, and his hair appears brown, not red."
1229-0,"The object in front of the mirror is a pawn, while its reflection is a king. This is achieved through forced perspective. The person holding the phone moves it back, making the pawn appear smaller and further away, while the king in the background appears larger due to its closer proximity to the mirror. This creates the illusion that the pawn's reflection is a king.
"
1229-1,"The discrepancy between the object and its reflection is caused by forced perspective. The person holding the phone moves it away from the mirror, making the pawn in the foreground appear smaller than the king reflected in the mirror. This creates the illusion that the pawn is seeing itself as a king in the reflection.
"
1229-2,"Yes, the difference between the object (a pawn) and its reflection (a king) is due to the use of a panoramic photography feature.

As the person moves the phone horizontally, the panoramic feature stitches together multiple images. The pawn is moved out of the frame and replaced with a king while the phone is panning across the mirror. The mirror reflects the king, creating the illusion that the pawn's reflection is a king."
1229-3,"No. The mirror in the video is a flat, circular mirror. The reflection is different because the person filming uses a forced perspective technique. The person filming moves the phone and the chess pieces to create the illusion that the pawn is reflecting as a king. This is confirmed at [00:00:00–00:00:02] when another person adjusts the chess pieces while the person filming moves the phone."
1229-7,"C.

The video shows a person taking a panoramic photo of a chess pawn and a circular mirror reflecting a chess king. The panoramic photo feature distorts the image, making the pawn appear smaller than its reflection in the mirror. The video does not provide evidence of special editing techniques, convex or concave mirrors being used. Thus, the correct answer is C."
1231-0,"The water in the waterfall does not flow backward. The video shows a man walking in front of a waterfall. Another person films the reflection of the man in a puddle. When the phone is rotated, the reflection of the man and the waterfall are shown from a different perspective, making it appear as if the waterfall is flowing upward."
1231-1,The waterfall appears to be flowing in reverse because the videographer rotates their phone 90 degrees while filming the reflection of the waterfall in a puddle. This creates the illusion that the waterfall is defying gravity.
1231-2,"No. The backward flow of the waterfall is not due to reverse video processing. The video shows a man taking a picture of a reflection in a puddle. The reflection shows the man standing in front of the waterfall. When the phone is rotated, the image on the phone also rotates, making it appear as though the waterfall is flowing upwards."
1231-3,"Yes, the waterfall appears to flow upwards in the video due to a special effect. The person holding the phone rotates it 90 degrees while filming the reflection of the waterfall in a puddle. This creates the illusion that the waterfall is defying gravity."
1231-7,"None of the provided options accurately describe what happens in the video. The apparent backward flow of the waterfall is achieved by filming the reflection of a man walking in front of the waterfall in a puddle. The camera is then rotated to align with the vertical orientation of the phone screen displayed on the phone held above the puddle, creating the illusion that the waterfall is flowing upwards. Therefore, the correct answer would be E. None of the above."
1233-0,The final image shows two reflections because the photographer used a panoramic photo setting. The video shows the photographer taking a panoramic photo of a woman kneeling by a puddle. The final image shows the woman and the reflection of the man who was standing behind her when the photo was taken.
1233-1,"The statement is incorrect. There are two people visible in the reflection in the water. The video shows a woman kneeling by a puddle, and a man standing behind her. Both are reflected in the puddle. The video then shows the phone screen as a panoramic photo is taken. The final image shows the woman, her reflection, and the reflection of the man who was standing behind her."
1233-2,"No. The two reflections are not due to the use of a panoramic camera function. The video shows a person kneeling by a puddle, with another person standing behind them. The reflection in the puddle shows both people. The video then shows the phone screen as a panoramic photo is taken. The final image shows the kneeling person and their reflection, as well as the reflection of the person standing behind them. The panoramic function did not create the second reflection, as it was already present in the puddle."
1233-3,No. The two reflections are not due to image synthesis technology. The video shows a person taking a panoramic photo of a woman kneeling by a puddle. The puddle reflects both the woman and a man standing behind her. The final image shows the reflection of both people in the puddle.

1235-2,"Yes, based on the pattern in the video, 4 + 3 = 47.

The video presents a math quiz with a pattern. The first number is multiplied by 10 and added to the second number. For example, 2 + 2 = (2 * 10) + 2 = 22. However, the video shows 2 + 2 = 24. Similarly, 3 + 3 = (3 * 10) + 3 = 33, but the video shows 3 + 3 = 36. And 4 + 5 = (4 * 10) + 5 = 45, but the video shows 4 + 5 = 59. Following this pattern, 4 + 3 = (4 * 10) + 3 = 43. However, based on the pattern in the video, the answer is 47."
1235-3,"No, 4 + 3 does not equal 412 according to the pattern in the video. The pattern is to multiply the first number by the sum of the two numbers. For example, 2 + 2 = 4, and 2 x 4 = 24. Following this pattern, 4 + 3 = 7, and 4 x 7 = 28. Therefore, 4 + 3 = 28 according to the pattern in the video."

The video presents a math quiz with a pattern.
2 + 2 = 24
3 + 3 = 36
4 + 5 = 59
4 + 3 = ?

Following the established pattern, the answer is derived by concatenating the first number with the sum of the two numbers. In this case, 4 + 3 = 7. Concatenating 4 and 7 gives 47. Since 47 is not an option, and the closest option is 43, which follows the pattern of concatenating the first addend with a number, the answer is A."
1236-0,"No. The method shown in the video does not produce correct calculation results.

The video shows a series of calculations where each number is first multiplied by 2 and then divided by 5. For example, 10 multiplied by 2 is 20, and 20 divided by 5 is 4, not 2 as shown in the video. Similarly, 30 multiplied by 2 is 60, and 60 divided by 5 is 12, not 6. The same incorrect method is applied to 60 and 90."
1236-1,"Yes, the method demonstrated in the video effectively yields accurate calculation results.

The video shows a series of division problems where the dividends are multiples of 10 and the divisor is 5. The video demonstrates a shortcut method where each dividend is first multiplied by 2, and then divided by 5. The results shown in the video are accurate:

10 x 2 = 20; 20 ÷ 5 = 2
30 x 2 = 60; 60 ÷ 5 = 6
60 x 2 = 120; 120 ÷ 5 = 12
90 x 2 = 180; 180 ÷ 5 = 18"

The video shows the answers as 2, 6, 12, and 18, respectively. These answers are incorrect. However, if the correct answers are calculated, the method is effective."
1236-3,"No, the method shown in the video is not ineffective. The video demonstrates a method for quickly dividing multiples of 10 by 5. The method involves multiplying the given number by 2 and then dividing by 10. This is mathematically equivalent to dividing by 5. For example, 10 multiplied by 2 is 20. 20 divided by 10 is 2. 10 divided by 5 is also 2."
1236-7,"B.

The video demonstrates a ""trick"" for dividing multiples of 10 by 5. The trick involves first multiplying the dividend by 2, which is equivalent to squaring the numbers, and then dividing the result by 5. For example, 10 multiplied by 2 is 20, and 20 divided by 5 is 4. The video shows this process for 10, 30, 60, and 90."
1237-0,"According to the video, the answer to 9 + 9 = 27.

The video presents a pattern where the sum of two identical numbers is multiplied by the first number. For example, 4 + 4 = 8, but the pattern suggests 4 x (4+4)/2 = 4 x 4 = 16. Similarly, 5 + 5 = 15, but the pattern suggests 5 x (5+5)/2 = 5 x 5 = 25. And 6 + 6 = 24, but the pattern suggests 6 x (6+6)/2 = 6 x 6 = 36. Following this pattern, 9 + 9 would be 9 x (9+9)/2 = 9 x 9 = 81. However, the video shows the answers as 08, 15, and 24. The pattern here is that the first number is multiplied by the second number plus one. So, 4 x (4+1)/2 = 10, 5 x (5+1)/2 = 15, 6 x (6+1)/2 = 21. Following this pattern, 9 + 9 would be 9 x (9+1)/2 = 45. However, the video shows the answers as 08, 15, and 24. The pattern here is that the first number is multiplied by the second number plus one, but the answer is not divided by two. So, 4 x (4+1) = 20, 5 x (5+1) = 30, 6 x (6+1) = 42. Following this pattern, 9 + 9 would be 9 x (9+1) = 90. However, the video shows the answers as 08, 15, and 24. The pattern here is that the first number is multiplied by the second number plus one, but the answer is not divided by two. Also, the answer is not correct. So, 4 + 4 = 8, 5 + 5 = 10, but the video shows 15. 6 + 6 = 12, but the video shows 24. Following this pattern, 9 + 9 would be 18, but the video shows 27."
1237-1,"According to the pattern in the video, 9 + 9 = 90.

The video presents a pattern where the sum of two identical numbers is calculated by multiplying the sum by the first addend. For example, 4 + 4 is presented as 8 (4 + 4 = 8), and then 8 is multiplied by 4, resulting in 32. However, the video displays 08 instead of 32. Similarly, 5 + 5 is presented as 10 (5 + 5 = 10), and then 10 is multiplied by 5, resulting in 50. However, the video displays 15 instead of 50. Following this pattern, 6 + 6 is presented as 12 (6 + 6 = 12), and then 12 is multiplied by 6, resulting in 72. However, the video displays 24 instead of 72. Therefore, 9 + 9 is presented as 18 (9 + 9 = 18), and then 18 is multiplied by 9, resulting in 90."
1237-2,"No. The video shows the following pattern:

4 + 4 = 8 (4 x 2 = 8)
5 + 5 = 15 (5 x 3 = 15)
6 + 6 = 24 (6 x 4 = 24)

Following this pattern, 9 + 9 would be 9 multiplied by the next integer, which is 5. Therefore, 9 + 9 = 45 (9 x 5 = 45), not 63."
1237-3,"Yes, based on the pattern in the video, 9 + 9 = 72.

The video presents a pattern where the numbers on the left side of the equation are added together, and then multiplied by the first number in the equation.

4 + 4 = 8, and 8 x 4 = 32. However, the video shows 4 + 4 = 08.
5 + 5 = 10, and 10 x 5 = 50. However, the video shows 5 + 5 = 15.
6 + 6 = 12, and 12 x 6 = 72. However, the video shows 6 + 6 = 24.

Following this pattern, 9 + 9 = 18, and 18 x 9 = 162. However, if the pattern in the video is followed, 9 + 9 = 27. The video does not show the answer to 9 + 9."
1237-7,"B.

The video presents a pattern where the numbers are added, and then the sum is multiplied by the first addend.
4 + 4 = 8 (4 x 2 = 8 or 4 + 4 = 8)
5 + 5 = 15 (5 x 3 = 15)
6 + 6 = 24 (6 x 4 = 24)
Following this pattern, 9 + 9 = ? would be 9 x 7 = 63.

It is possible the child was comforted by their caregiver, or perhaps distracted by something off-camera. The video only shows the events, not the child's internal state or motivations.
"
1344-1,"The child in the video smiles after the injection is finished and a bandage is placed on their leg. The adult holding the child appears to be comforting and interacting with them, which seems to shift the child's attention from the injection and cause them to smile."
1344-2,"Yes, the child smiles after the injection because the pain subsides once the needle is removed.

At [00:00:03], the child cries out in pain as the needle is inserted. Once the needle is removed and a band-aid is applied, the child continues to cry for a few seconds. However, at [00:00:14], the child stops crying and starts to smile. This suggests that the pain has subsided."
1344-3,No. The video shows the child crying immediately after the injection. The child stops crying and smiles without any visible comforting actions from the person holding them. The person holding the child does smile and laugh after the child stops crying.
0340-2,"Yes, it is true that there are four drainage channels visible in the video.

At [00:00:15–00:00:17], the man builds a three-layer high opening in the wall, and uses three hollow bricks to create four drainage channels. These channels are visible throughout the rest of the video."
0880-1,"When the arrow-shaped structure is lifted by hand, its perceived direction changes.

Initially, the arrow appears to point to the right. However, when it is lifted and rotated, the arrow appears to point to the left. This is demonstrated between [00:00:16 to 00:00:22] in the video."
0880-2,"Yes, the structure loses its directional illusion when held up towards the camera.

At the beginning of the video, the arrow-shaped structure appears to point to the right. However, when the presenter rotates the structure towards the camera at [00:00:17–00:00:21], it becomes clear that the structure is not a simple 2D arrow, but a 3D object with multiple facets. This reveals that the perceived directionality is an illusion created by the specific viewing angle."
0880-3,"Yes, the structure appears to change direction when lifted due to its interaction with a mirror.

Initially, the arrow-shaped structure points to the right. When a mirror is placed behind the structure, the reflection appears to point to the left. When the structure is lifted and rotated, the actual structure still points to the right, but the reflection in the mirror appears to point to the right as well. This is because the structure is not symmetrical on all axes."
0880-7,"C.

The video shows a white arrow-shaped structure placed on a small wooden block. When the structure is pushed from any direction, it wobbles but maintains its directional illusion. However, when the structure is lifted from the wooden block, as shown from [00:00:17–00:00:21], it loses its directional illusion and appears as a flat, multi-faceted object."
0886-0,"The man in the video is wearing a watch on his left wrist. It can be seen throughout the video, including at [00:00:00] and [00:00:05]."
0910-3,No. The man is not helping the child cross the street. He picks up the child and carries them away from the street and into a doorway. This action is repeated several times throughout the video.
0957-1,"The substance was transferred to the rod by using tweezers to pull it out of the beaker.

At [00:00:13–00:00:16], the presenter shows a bottle of hexamethylenediamine. At [00:00:38–00:00:40], the presenter shows a bottle of cyclohexane. These two substances are combined in a beaker at [00:00:58–00:01:05]. At [00:01:13–00:01:17], the presenter uses tweezers to pull a stringy substance out of the beaker. At [00:01:21–00:01:28], the presenter wraps the stringy substance around a glass rod and continues to pull it out of the beaker."
1053-1,"Based on the video, the man in the black T-shirt is not trying to convey anything by lifting his black hat. He is wearing a hoodie with a pizza print on it, and he pulls the hood over his head at the beginning of the video. He does not wear or touch a black hat at any point."
1053-2,"No. The man in the black T-shirt is not raising his hat to make it seem like the middle seat is occupied. He is wearing a hoodie with a pizza design on the hood, and he has pulled the hood over his head. A man in a brown jacket sits down in the middle seat next to him."
1111-2,"No, it was the woman in the green sari who decided to sit down after standing up instead of joining the dance. The woman in the brown and red sari danced with the man in the brown hoodie."
1112-0,"The man in the blue shirt took the firework.

At the beginning of the video, both men are seen crouching near the bucket. The man in the pink shirt places the firework under the bucket, and they both run away. Later, the man in the pink shirt returns to the bucket and lifts it, expecting to find the firework. Instead, he finds only the lighter. The video then rewinds to the beginning and shows the man in the blue shirt taking the firework while the other man is distracted. The video then cuts to the man in the blue shirt emerging from an outhouse covered in soot, implying that the firework went off inside with him."
1117-2,"Yes, it was the person in the blue shirt who caused the water to overflow. At [00:00:49], the water begins to overflow the glass while the person in the blue shirt is holding it. He then drinks the water in the glass at [00:00:52]."
1134-1,The ball was thrown upwards and slightly to the right of the basketball hoop. The ball then bounced off the roof of the covered patio and went through the hoop.
1134-3,"No. The ball in the last scene did not descend directly towards the basketball hoop. After the man threw the ball, it went over the hoop and landed on the roof of the house behind the hoop, as seen from [00:00:13–00:00:15]."
1169-1,"The man in black and white clothing was not shattered by the soccer ball. The video shows the man kicking up bowling pins and other objects behind him, creating the illusion of shattering. The man himself remains intact."
1169-7,"A.

The man in the referee shirt kicks the soccer ball toward the other man, who kicks it back. The referee then appears to explode into pieces. However, this is clearly a video editing trick. The man reappears fully intact a moment later, wearing a black shirt and shorts."
1170-1,"The containers did not vanish. They fell off the ship into the water. A worker was using a remote control to operate a crane that was moving containers from the ship. The crane malfunctioned, causing the containers to fall."
1173-0,"The person in the back seat did not disappear. At [00:00:02], the car suddenly brakes, causing the drinks and food the person was holding to spill everywhere. The person is still visible in the back seat, covered in the spilled contents."
1175-0,The bear in the video is a chalk drawing. It does not move on its own. The video uses CGI to make it appear as though the bear is moving.
1177-0,"The man did not suddenly stand on another boat. He jumped off a pier into the water, and then swam toward a small yellow and white motorboat. He then climbed aboard the motorboat."
1183-0,"The sky did not darken. The man in the video closed the blinds on his window, making the room appear darker.  This is evident between [00:00:02–00:00:03]."
1206-1,"The blue paint appears to spill upwards because the video is filmed upside down. The camera is placed on the floor facing the ceiling, and the person is standing on the ceiling. When the paint is released, it falls towards the floor (which appears to be the ceiling in the inverted video)."
1206-2,"Yes, the blue paint appears to spill upwards because the entire set is upside down. The camera is placed on the floor, facing the ceiling. The man and the paint can are also upside down, but the video is rotated 180 degrees, creating the illusion that the paint is defying gravity."
1206-7,"C.

The video is filmed from below, looking up. The person, wall, and curtain appear to be on the ceiling. The person holds the paint can upright, relative to the camera's perspective. However, because the camera is upside down, the paint appears to defy gravity and spill upwards."
1214-1,"The camera zooms out while rotating around the woman lying on the green boat-shaped sofa.  The video starts with a close-up shot of the woman and gradually expands to show the entire spiral staircase surrounding her.
"
1225-7,C. A man in a gray Under Armour t-shirt.
1260-3,"Yes, the man in the white shirt is surprised by the spiciness of the food. At the beginning of the video, he takes a bite and immediately reacts with a surprised expression. The man next to him also reacts to the spiciness by wiping his mouth with a napkin. The video then uses meme overlays to emphasize the spicy reaction."
1294-0,"Based on the video, the question's premise is incorrect. The chef places two pieces of corn on the grill first, followed by a steak. The video does not explain why the chef placed the food on the grill."
1298-0,"The man's football did return to him. After the boy kicks the ball to the man, the man kicks it back to the boy, who then kicks it back to the man. The man then kicks the ball into a blue barrel."
1298-2,No. The man's football did not land in the blue bucket. It hit the brick wall behind the bucket and bounced back towards him.
1344-7,"C.

The video shows a baby getting an injection. The baby cries when the needle is inserted, but as soon as it is removed and a band-aid is applied, the baby stops crying and starts to smile. The video does not show any toys, comforting actions, or interesting environmental stimuli that could have caused the baby's smile. Therefore, the most likely reason for the baby's smile is that the pain subsided once the needle was removed.
